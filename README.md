# Magic the Terminal

This project aims to make an arena game based on Magic the Gathering's Commander style game

The current TODO list includes:
* setting up an sqlite3 database for the cards
* setup ncurses, to render the game
* gather enough data on MTG cards to have a deck
* setup specific classes for all card types
* create a reader function, that can read card information from a file and turn into a card object
* create an Effect class, that handles special triggers

Current done list:
* [2021-11-07]: Created Land class and parser from CSV file
* [2021-11-06]: Created logging singleton
* [2021-11-06]: created base Card class
