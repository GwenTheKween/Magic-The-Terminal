# Magic the Terminal

This project aims to make an arena game based on Magic the Gathering's Commander style game

The current TODO list includes:
* setting up an sqlite3 database for the cards
* setup ncurses, to render the game
* gather enough data on MTG cards to have a deck
* setup a card class, to hold important information
* create a logger as a singleton class
